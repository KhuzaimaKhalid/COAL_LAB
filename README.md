## 📚 Repository overview

This repo stores lab assignments, assembly programs, and supporting files created during COAL lab sessions. Each lab should be organized in its own folder and include source code, sample input/output where applicable, and a short description or README explaining the exercise.

## 🛠 Tools & Simulators (recommended)

Below is the tool on which the coding is done


### emu8086 / DOSBox (8086 assembly) — Windows

* Use `emu8086` for 16-bit x86 

### emu8086 (Windows)

* Open `emu8086.exe` → Load your `.asm` project → Assemble & Run inside the emulator.

If you paste your lab folder list (or paste filenames), I can populate the README with exact lab names and — if you want — generate a short `README.md` for each lab folder automatically.
